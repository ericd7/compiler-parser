Ehren Katzur's original score

When I first started Computer Science
at Algonquin College of Applied Arts and Technology
I had no idea how to
Write in C

I took a course named Compilers
Right after semester 3
where I would learn how to
Write in C

First project was the Buffer
"You can't have memory leaks!"
and if you find you do
You use Free();

Before I handed the buffer in
I tested it thoroughly
I was learning how to
Write in C

Second part was the scanner
Its job was finding Lexemes
It turned them into tokens
on the stream

DFAs and Keywords,
Tokens and State Machines
First half of the scanner, I did
Write in C

Next we had the symbol table
Which was declared globally
More thought than code on this one
Thankfully

There is always one more bug
"5,1,1, will crash perfectly"
To solve the problem I had to
Write in C

Finally was the parser
To build the syntax tree
Curse this silly grammar
It hates me

The First Set was not fun to build
No Follow Set, I'm relieved
How will I ever turn this,
into C?

"Void Production Name (void)
is really all you need."
Now we all can go, and
Write in C

"Before you submit this one
It must work flawlessly
Or you'll spend your summer indoors
Writing C"

Now I'm done compilers
The marks came easily
Because all semester long, I
wrote in C

Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C,
Now I just love to
Write in C.

Michael Jackson's original score

I walked into battle, armed with C;
A glorious victory I did guarantee;
But slaying the dragon was not meant to be;
A platypus discovered the memory leaks in me!

Mixed measurement, dangling pointers, overflow;
Memory leak, infinite recursion, many stacks I did blow;
Invalid range, spec violation;
Why is my compiler in such a situation?

Please parse well, or I'm a big giant liar;
To pass this course, is my one desire;
Why is that platypus, giving me a wink?
He says that I too will soon be extinct!

Creating tokens, by spotting lexemes;
Everything's a little more complex, then it first seems;
With all these functions, it will surely be late;
No problem: simply do the bonus, it will compensate.

So much garbage, printed on my display;
Arrays of characters, teach me the character of arrays;
Learn the language, at a fast pace;
Write the code well, and get a smiley face;

Don't forget the errors, in the grammar;
With so many productions, upon which to stammer;
Write the definition, and the declaration;
Define your constants, try enumeration.

Create the sets well, First then Follow;
Write the parser in chunks, it's easier to swallow;
Follow the terminals, in advancing the look-a-head;
Prepare to spend many a night, away from your bed.

When nothing works, and you can't match the test files;
Take a break, write beautiful Java, and think awhile;
With so much time spent, on a single token,
Why are you telling me, my finite state machine is broken?
